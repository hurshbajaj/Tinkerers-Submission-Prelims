#Pointers

The Project submitted, is an idea for a project/blog hub where people from all around the country can share their ideas, as expresssed in the About card,
It is worth mentioning that I'm working alone and hence all the assests, including the buildings, etc. are custom made by me.

As discussed, I was not allowed to use frameworks and hence couldn't make the same functioning with a backend either...
